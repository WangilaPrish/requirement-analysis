# 📘 Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Welcome to the `requirement-analysis` repository! This project provides a comprehensive guide to the Requirement Analysis phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), using a **booking management system** as a case study. Whether you're a student, developer, or analyst, this resource will help you understand, document, and implement better software requirements.

## 🧠 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a systematic process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or existing software system.

### ✨ Why it matters:
- Ensures clarity and alignment between stakeholders and developers.
- Forms the foundation for planning, design, development, and testing.
- Helps prevent scope creep and costly changes later in the project.

## ❓ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. ✅ **Defines Scope Clearly**  
   Prevents misunderstandings by outlining exactly what is expected from the software.

2. 💰 **Saves Time and Costs**  
   Early identification of problems reduces the need for expensive fixes later.

3. 🧪 **Enables Effective Testing**  
   Helps QA teams to create test cases that reflect real user expectations.

## 🔑 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering:**  
  Collecting input through interviews, surveys, focus groups, and observations.

- **Requirement Elicitation:**  
  Clarifying and understanding the needs behind the gathered information.

- **Requirement Documentation:**  
  Writing clear, concise, and structured requirement documents.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:**  
  Breaking down and visualizing requirements using models or diagrams.

- **Requirement Validation:**  
  Ensuring the documented requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs.

## 📂 Types of Requirements

### 1️⃣ Functional Requirements

> These describe **what** the system should do.

**Examples from Booking Management System:**
- Users can search for properties by location and date.
- Hosts can list new properties.
- Users can book and cancel reservations.

### 2️⃣ Non-functional Requirements

> These describe **how** the system performs under various conditions.

**Examples:**
- The system should load search results in under 2 seconds.
- Booking operations should have 99.9% uptime.
- User data must be encrypted both at rest and in transit.

---

## 🧾 Use Case Diagrams

**Use Case Diagrams** visualize how users (actors) interact with the system. They help define the system's boundaries and user roles.

### 🎯 Benefits:
- Simple to understand and communicate.
- Highlights functional expectations early on.

**📌 Example – Booking System Use Case Diagram:**

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance Criteria** define the conditions that a software feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders.

### 📌 Importance:
- Ensures that features fulfill functional requirements.
- Provides a clear checklist for developers and testers.
- Avoids ambiguity by setting measurable goals.

### 🧾 Example – Checkout Feature:

- [ ] User must be able to review property details before payment.
- [ ] Checkout form must validate required fields (dates, guests, payment info).
- [ ] Confirmation email is sent after successful booking.
- [ ] Booking appears in the user’s dashboard within 5 seconds.
